P.S: The plotting of the graph from the sensor values isn't complete. The tracking of user activity using motion sensor isnt done yet due to time constraints. I plan on completing and udating this repository further. Also the location data given could not be marked on the map, although other test data has been marked. Please review the source code.

This is an assignment app created for an internship assignment. App consists of three separate assignments
The first assignment downloads an external file. Extracts the string resources and saves them in the phone contacts.

The second assignment tracks the temperature, humidity, pressure and light sensor readings and updates them on the screen.
ToDo: Plot the values from the sensors in a graph.

(Incomplete) The third assignment, which isnt done yet, tracks user activity from the motion sensors.
